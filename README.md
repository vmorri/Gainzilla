# Gainzilla - A simple workout app to get you lifting

## System overview

There are few apps out there in the Google Play Store that focus on tracking lifts and the ones that do are often complicated with too many features and not enough practicality. Our workout app will present you a better alternative by providing a simple interface to record workouts and visualize strength progress. Have no idea what kind of workout you would like to follow? Our app gives you a few popular workouts to start off from so that you can spend more time learning the movements. Are you one of the many users who has been working out for a while and is already following a program? Our app will allow you to create your own workouts as you do it and save it as a template for future sessions. This is essential for many of you who travel often and have to be flexible with the equipment you use. A few clicks away from the workout session part of the app will redirect you to our line graph functionality which will calculate strength based on the one rep max formula to determine if you have been progressing over time. This app is for a group project as part of a class for George Mason University
